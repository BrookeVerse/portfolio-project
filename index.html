        <p class="bioArea">
          My name is Brooke and I have been working for years in hospitality and retail for years.
          You may think that this may have nothing to do with being a developer, however. 
          I have had a lot of time to build my confidence when it comes to talking to people. 
          I have also worked in many teams, knowing how to be helpful and work with other people. 
          Outside of work I am really into gaming, mostly MMOs, TheSims, and FPS's. TheSims was actually
          my first introduction to coding as a friend of mine created mods for the game. I would help them where 
          I could and inspired me to learn and grow in the software field.
